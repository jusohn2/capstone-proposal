# Capstone Proposal 

## 1. Stoke Prediction Problem 
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

We will be predicting the occurence of a stroke based on some parameters such as the age, gender and some medical parameters for the individual as bmi, heart disease and hypertension. We will be using logistic regression technique with different models.

## 2. Weather Forecast for Delhi City
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data?search=time+series

The Dataset is fully dedicated for the developers who want to train the model on Weather Forecasting for Indian climate. This dataset provides data from 1st January 2013 to 24th April 2017 in the city of Delhi, India. The 4 parameters here are meantemp, humidity, wind_speed, meanpressure. It's a time series problem so we will be using time series models.

## 3. Customer Segmentation Classification
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/kaushiksuresh147/customer-segmentation?select=Train.csv

An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve deduced that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market. In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments. Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has work e exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers. We will be using unsupervised classification regression models.
